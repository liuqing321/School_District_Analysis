# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose 
The purpose is to analyze the information from all standardized tests and prvoide the insights about performance trends and patterns in the standardized tests. 
These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Because the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered, so those data must be removed from the standardized tests analysis.
